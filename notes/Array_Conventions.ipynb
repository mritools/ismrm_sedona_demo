    "Array Storage Order\n",
    "===================\n",
    "In Python (and C), n-dimensional arrays are typically stored in row-major order, whereas `Fortran` or `Matlab` default to column-major ordering.  `mrrt.mri` uses the Fortran (column-major) ordering convention to better match other similar MRI toolboxes such as Gadgetron, the Berkley Advanced Reconstruction Toolbox (BART), and the Michigan Image Reconstruction Toolbox (MIRT).\n",
    "\n",
    "For an array stored in contiguous memory, column major order means that the elements along the first dimension of the array are adjacent in memory while those along the last axis are the farthest appart.  This is particularly important to remember when reshaping arrays.  Functions such as `ravel` and `reshape` in the `NumPy` package assume C (row-major) ordering by default.  To get the desired Fortran ordering, one must pass `order='F'` to these functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for the following 2D matrix of shape (3, 2) (axis 0 is displayed vertically):\n",
    "$$a = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 4 \\\\ 2 & 5 \\\\ 3 & 6 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling `numpy.ravel(a, order='F')` would create the following 1D vector.\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "(note that the output of ravel will have a shape that is (6, ) so it is not specifically a column or row vector)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the array was originally created with Fortran ordering, this also corresponds to the order of the elements of the original array in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling `numpy.ravel(a, order='C')` would create the following 1D vector.\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 4 & 2 & 5 & 3 & 6 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
